# Hot-Takes--Ranking-hot-sauces-app

An app where users can create accounts and log in. 
Logged in users can create posts, in this case, it's for hot sauces, and they can rank their favourites by giving each sauce a rating. 
This rating is saved, and other users can also rate the hot sauces of other sauces. 
The app has full CRUD for both the sauces and the user profiles!
The appâ€™s front end has been developed using Angular and has been precompiled after internal testing.
Data stored securely using NoSQL MongoDb database. 

# Development server
